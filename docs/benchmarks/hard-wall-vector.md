# Hard-Wall Vector Benchmark

## Scientific source

The benchmark follows J. Erlich, E. Katz, D. T. Son, and M. A. Stephanov,
“QCD and a Holographic Model of Hadrons,” *Physical Review Letters* **95**,
261602 (2005),
[arXiv:hep-ph/0501128](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0501128), especially Eq.
(5) and the following vector-mode discussion.

## Equation and boundary conditions

For a transverse vector mode on the AdS5 slice, the source equation is

```text
partial_z[(1/z) partial_z V_n] + (m_n^2/z) V_n = 0.
```

The benchmark preserves the two boundary conditions and their different
physical roles:

```text
UV normalizability:  V_n(epsilon) = 0,
IR wall:             partial_z V_n(z_m) = 0.
```

In the zero-cutoff analytic limit, the spectrum is

```text
m_n z_m = j_(0,n+1),
```

where `j_(0,n+1)` is a positive zero of `J_0`. The implementation uses
`scipy.special.jn_zeros` rather than implementing a Bessel-zero routine.

## Independent numerical routes

The dimensionless coordinate `x = z/z_m` gives

```text
V''(x) - V'(x)/x + lambda^2 V(x) = 0,
lambda = m z_m.
```

HoloForge solves this problem in three genuinely different maintained-library
formulations:

1. adaptive `solve_ivp` shooting with a Brent `root_scalar` search for the IR
   Neumann residual; and
2. global `solve_bvp` collocation with `lambda` as an unknown parameter; and
3. Chebyshev--Gauss--Lobatto pseudospectral collocation, expressed as a dense
   generalized eigenproblem with explicit UV Dirichlet and IR Neumann rows and
   solved by SciPy's `eigvals`.

At the documented defaults, the first four normalized shooting and
collocation spectra differ by about `4.2e-11` or less. The shooting ratios
differ from the zero-cutoff Bessel ratios by about `7.4e-8` or less. These
numbers are development evidence, not a claim of empirical precision.

The spectral route records polynomial degrees 24, 32, and 40. At the documented
defaults, the maximum relative change between the final two spectra is about
`2.4e-12`. Its approximately `7.4e-8` disagreement with the zero-cutoff Bessel
ratios remains because `epsilon/z_m = 1e-4` is finite; this is not spectral
discretization error.

The cutoff study uses three decreasing values:

```text
epsilon/z_m = 1e-2, 3e-3, 1e-3.
```

The maximum ratio error decreases at every level. Finite-cutoff error is
reported separately from integration, root, and collocation tolerances.

## Run the verifier

```bash
holoforge verify hard-wall-vector
holoforge verify hard-wall-vector --method collocation --json
holoforge verify hard-wall-vector --method spectral --json
```

## Interpretation limits

The hard wall and its IR boundary condition are phenomenological inputs. The
source paper itself treats the IR choice as a crude model ingredient rather
than something fixed uniquely by QCD. Passing this verifier shows that the
implemented equations and numerical routes reproduce their analytic target;
it does not establish the hard-wall construction as a precision QCD model.
